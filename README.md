Database Operations and Concepts:

Grouping:
Description: Used to aggregate data based on certain criteria. For example, you might group students by class to calculate average marks or by subject to find the total number of students.
SQL Example: SELECT class, AVG(marks) FROM student_marks GROUP BY class;

Joins:
Description: Used to combine rows from two or more tables based on related columns. Joins help in retrieving comprehensive data from multiple tables.
Types of Joins:
INNER JOIN: Returns records with matching values in both tables.
SQL Example: SELECT students.name, marks.subject, marks.marks FROM students INNER JOIN marks ON students.student_id = marks.student_id;
LEFT JOIN: Returns all records from the left table and matched records from the right table. Unmatched records will have NULL values.
SQL Example: SELECT students.name, bus.route FROM students LEFT JOIN bus ON students.bus_id = bus.bus_id;
RIGHT JOIN: Returns all records from the right table and matched records from the left table. Unmatched records will have NULL values.
SQL Example: SELECT library_books.title, students.name FROM library_books RIGHT JOIN student_library ON library_books.book_id = student_library.book_id;
FULL JOIN: Returns all records when there is a match in either left or right table. (Not available in MySQL directly but can be simulated using UNION.)
SQL Example: SELECT students.name FROM students LEFT JOIN scholarship ON students.scholarship_id = scholarship.scholarship_id UNION SELECT scholarship.name FROM scholarship LEFT JOIN students ON scholarship.scholarship_id = students.scholarship_id;
These elements collectively enable efficient management and analysis of school data, enhancing operational effectiveness and decision-making.
